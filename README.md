## Custom ERC20 Token
This project is a requirement for the ETH + AVAX course in metacrafters. This demonstrates the use and capabilities of an ERC20 token. This serves as an intermediate requirement for learning ETH and AVAX.

## Description
This program is a contract in Solidity, a programming program language used for developing smart contracts in Ethereum. ERC20 token is a standard for fungible tokens. This contract demonstrates the implementation and functionality of ERC20. The contract has multiple function that are stated below.

### Functions:
* A decimal function that overrides the decimal function of ERC20.
* A mint functions to mint the tokens for the one who deployed the contract.
* A burn function to burn tokens.
* A transferToken function to transfer tokens to another user.

## Setting Up Remix
* Download the solidity file in this repository.
* To deploy the contract, use Remix: [https://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org). Remix is an Etheruem IDE that can run solidity code.
* In Remix, open the solidity file using open a file from your file system. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0fb7317-61c1-4576-8b68-53a65f5561d0)

## Executing program

* To execute the contract, first check if the compiler version is compatible with the contract. Click ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43ed93f2-1886-4b57-a795-2af4d692d3d1) and set the compiler to version: 0.8.13.
* To compile, click ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e866783f-6724-4da5-8c23-b5612a18c591)
* After compiling, click ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de497efc-809e-4245-8e83-88138805492f). Here you can deploy the contract.
* You can now input the initialSupply of the custom token then click transact.
* Once deployed, interact with the contract by going to the "Deployed/Unpinned Contracts" and clicking on the custom token. Here you can call the functions of the contract including the functions stated above.
